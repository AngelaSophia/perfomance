    I have planed to wake up at 5:00am to go through the past code we have 
    done and  have made a time table that will guid me to work on that.
    Am going to start on one project of javascript on making a watch that is functioning.
    I have a group that will help me to go through the code and any other academic work.
    You can go through it and change what is not GeolocationCoordinates.
